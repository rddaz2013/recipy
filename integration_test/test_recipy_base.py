"""
Base class for recipy tests.

Sub-classes use a Python script (run_numpy.py) about which the following
assumptions are made:

* Co-located with this test script, in the same directory.
* Imports recipy.
* Expects two arguments via the command-line: an input file
  of comma-separated values and an output file name.
* Reads the input file and creates the output file using numpy,
  which recipy is configured to log.
* Prints nothing to standard output.
